# 1. Architecture Overview

## 1.1 System Design Philosophy

AetherCycle's smart contract architecture embodies the "Pure Protocol" design philosophy, where every component operates autonomously without human intervention. This approach eliminates traditional DeFi risks associated with admin keys, upgrade mechanisms, and centralized control.

**Core Design Principles:**

**Immutability by Design**
All contracts are deployed without upgrade mechanisms, admin functions, or pause capabilities. Once deployed, the protocol operates according to its mathematical rules indefinitely.

**Autonomous Operation**
Every function that requires periodic execution includes incentive mechanisms for community members to trigger operations, ensuring the protocol continues functioning without developer intervention.

**Mathematical Certainty**
All economic parameters are hardcoded and mathematically proven to ensure sustainable operation under all market conditions.

**Gas Optimization**
Contracts are optimized for Base network's low-cost environment while maintaining security and functionality.

## 1.2 Contract Interaction Map

The AetherCycle protocol consists of 15+ interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a fully autonomous DeFi ecosystem:

**Primary Contracts:**
- AEC Token Contract (AEC.sol)
- PerpetualEngine (PerpetualEngine.sol)
- Mathematical Endowment (MathematicalEndowment.sol)
- Token Staking (AECStaking.sol)
- LP Staking (AECStakingLP.sol)
- NFT Staking (AECStakingNFT.sol)

**Supporting Contracts:**
- Governance (AECGovernance.sol)
- Fair Launch (FairLaunch.sol)
- Liquidity Deployer (LiquidityDeployer.sol)
- Aetheria NFT (AetheriaNFT.sol)
- AEC Gambit (AECGambit.sol)
- Security Bounty (SecurityBounty.sol)

**Interaction Flow:**
1. AEC Token Contract processes all transfers and applies taxes
2. Tax revenue flows to PerpetualEngine for processing
3. PerpetualEngine distributes funds according to fixed percentages
4. Staking contracts receive rewards and distribute to participants
5. Mathematical Endowment releases monthly funding
6. Governance contract manages founder accountability only

---PAGE_BREAK---

## 1.3 Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Sequence:**
The contracts must be deployed in a specific order to ensure proper initialization and interconnection:

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
1. AEC Token Contract
2. Mathematical Endowment
3. PerpetualEngine

**Phase 2: Staking System**
4. Token Staking Contract
5. LP Staking Contract
6. NFT Staking Contract

**Phase 3: Ecosystem Contracts**
7. Aetheria NFT Contract
8. AEC Gambit Contract
9. Governance Contract

**Phase 4: Launch Mechanism**
10. Fair Launch Contract
11. Liquidity Deployer Contract

**Initialization Process:**
After deployment, contracts must be initialized with proper addresses and parameters. This is a one-time process that cannot be repeated.

**Verification Requirements:**
All contracts will be verified on BaseScan immediately after deployment to ensure transparency and enable community auditing.

## 1.4 Network Specifications

**Base Network Advantages:**
- Low transaction costs (typically <$0.01)
- Fast finality (~2 seconds)
- Ethereum compatibility
- Growing ecosystem
- Coinbase backing

**Gas Optimization Strategies:**
- Batch operations where possible
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal external calls
- Optimized loop structures
- Strategic use of events vs storage

**Network Dependencies:**
- Uniswap V2 for DEX functionality
- Base network infrastructure
- Ethereum L1 for final settlement

# 2. AEC Token Contract

## 2.1 ERC-20 Implementation

The AEC token contract extends the standard ERC-20 implementation with integrated tax functionality and autonomous features.

**Contract Specification:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract AEC is ERC20 {
    string public constant name = "AetherCycle";
    string public constant symbol = "AEC";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
    uint256 public constant totalSupply = 888_888_888 * 10**18;
    
    // Tax system variables
    mapping(address => bool) public isExcludedFromTax;
    mapping(address => bool) public isApprovedContract;
    address public perpetualEngine;
    
    // Tax rates (immutable after deployment)
    uint256 public constant WALLET_TO_WALLET_TAX = 0;
    uint256 public constant OFFICIAL_DEX_TAX = 200; // 2.0%
    uint256 public constant APPROVED_CONTRACT_TAX = 250; // 2.5%
    uint256 public constant UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_TAX = 1000; // 10.0%
    uint256 public constant MEV_BOT_TAX = 1250; // 12.5%
}
\`\`\`

**Key Features:**
- Fixed supply of 888,888,888 tokens
- No minting capability
- Integrated tax system
- Automatic tax collection and forwarding

## 2.2 Tax System Integration

The "Tolerant Fortress" tax system is implemented directly in the token contract's transfer function:

**Tax Logic Flow:**
1. Check if sender/receiver is excluded from tax
2. Determine transaction type (wallet-to-wallet, DEX, contract)
3. Calculate appropriate tax rate
4. Deduct tax from transfer amount
5. Forward tax to PerpetualEngine
6. Complete transfer with remaining amount

**Tax Rate Determination:**
\`\`\`solidity
function getTaxRate(address from, address to) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Excluded addresses pay no tax
    if (isExcludedFromTax[from] || isExcludedFromTax[to]) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Wallet-to-wallet transfers
    if (!isContract(from) && !isContract(to)) {
        return WALLET_TO_WALLET_TAX;
    }
    
    // Official DEX (Uniswap V2)
    if (to == officialDEXPair || from == officialDEXPair) {
        return OFFICIAL_DEX_TAX;
    }
    
    // Approved contracts
    if (isApprovedContract[to] || isApprovedContract[from]) {
        return APPROVED_CONTRACT_TAX;
    }
    
    // MEV detection (high gas, specific patterns)
    if (detectMEV(from, to)) {
        return MEV_BOT_TAX;
    }
    
    // Unknown contracts
    return UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_TAX;
}
\`\`\`

---PAGE_BREAK---

## 2.3 Transfer Logic

The transfer function implements the complete tax logic while maintaining ERC-20 compatibility:

**Transfer Function Implementation:**
\`\`\`solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
    require(from != address(0), "Transfer from zero address");
    require(to != address(0), "Transfer to zero address");
    require(balanceOf(from) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    uint256 taxRate = getTaxRate(from, to);
    uint256 taxAmount = (amount * taxRate) / 10000;
    uint256 transferAmount = amount - taxAmount;
    
    // Execute transfer
    _balances[from] -= amount;
    _balances[to] += transferAmount;
    
    // Handle tax
    if (taxAmount > 0) {
        _balances[perpetualEngine] += taxAmount;
        emit Transfer(from, perpetualEngine, taxAmount);
        
        // Trigger PerpetualEngine processing if threshold met
        IPerpetualEngine(perpetualEngine).processTaxRevenue(taxAmount);
    }
    
    emit Transfer(from, to, transferAmount);
}
\`\`\`

**Security Considerations:**
- Reentrancy protection on all external calls
- Integer overflow protection (Solidity 0.8+)
- Address validation on all parameters
- Balance verification before transfers

## 2.4 Security Features

**Access Control:**
- No admin functions post-deployment
- Immutable tax rates and core parameters
- Limited approved contract management

**MEV Protection:**
- Dynamic MEV detection algorithms
- Higher tax rates for extractive behavior
- Gas pattern analysis
- Transaction timing analysis

**Audit Trail:**
- Comprehensive event logging
- Tax collection tracking
- Transfer history maintenance
- Error condition reporting

# 3. PerpetualEngine Contract

## 3.1 Revenue Processing Logic

The PerpetualEngine serves as the autonomous economic heart of the AEC protocol, processing all revenue streams and distributing funds according to fixed mathematical rules.

**Contract Architecture:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract PerpetualEngine {
    // Distribution percentages (immutable)
    uint256 public constant BURN_PERCENTAGE = 20;
    uint256 public constant LIQUIDITY_PERCENTAGE = 40;
    uint256 public constant REWARDS_PERCENTAGE = 40;
    
    // Revenue tracking
    uint256 public totalProcessed;
    uint256 public totalBurned;
    uint256 public totalLiquidity;
    uint256 public totalRewards;
    
    // Processing thresholds
    uint256 public constant MIN_PROCESSING_AMOUNT = 1000 * 10**18;
    uint256 public constant PROCESSOR_REWARD_RATE = 10; // 0.1%
    
    // Contract addresses
    address public aecToken;
    address public tokenStaking;
    address public lpStaking;
    address public nftStaking;
    address public uniswapPair;
}
\`\`\`

**Revenue Sources:**
1. Transaction taxes from AEC token transfers
2. Monthly releases from Mathematical Endowment
3. LP staking yields from protocol-owned liquidity
4. NFT minting fees from Aetheria collection
5. Gaming fees from AEC Gambit

**Processing Trigger:**
Anyone can trigger revenue processing when the accumulated amount exceeds the minimum threshold, earning 0.1% of the processed amount as incentive.

## 3.2 Distribution Mechanisms

**Automated Distribution Logic:**
\`\`\`solidity
function processRevenue() external {
    uint256 balance = IERC20(aecToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance >= MIN_PROCESSING_AMOUNT, "Insufficient balance");
    
    // Calculate distributions
    uint256 burnAmount = (balance * BURN_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
    uint256 liquidityAmount = (balance * LIQUIDITY_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
    uint256 rewardsAmount = (balance * REWARDS_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
    uint256 processorReward = (balance * PROCESSOR_REWARD_RATE) / 10000;
    
    // Execute burn
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(BURN_ADDRESS, burnAmount);
    
    // Add liquidity
    addLiquidity(liquidityAmount);
    
    // Distribute rewards
    distributeRewards(rewardsAmount);
    
    // Pay processor
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(msg.sender, processorReward);
    
    // Update tracking
    totalProcessed += balance;
    totalBurned += burnAmount;
    totalLiquidity += liquidityAmount;
    totalRewards += rewardsAmount;
    
    emit RevenueProcessed(balance, burnAmount, liquidityAmount, rewardsAmount);
}
\`\`\`

---PAGE_BREAK---

## 3.3 Automation Features

**Liquidity Addition Logic:**
The PerpetualEngine automatically adds liquidity to the AEC/USDC pair using 40% of all processed revenue:

\`\`\`solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 aecAmount) internal {
    // Split AEC amount in half
    uint256 aecForLiquidity = aecAmount / 2;
    uint256 aecForSwap = aecAmount - aecForLiquidity;
    
    // Swap half for USDC
    address[] memory path = new address[](2);
    path[0] = aecToken;
    path[1] = USDC_ADDRESS;
    
    IUniswapV2Router02(uniswapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(
        aecForSwap,
        0, // Accept any amount of USDC
        path,
        address(this),
        block.timestamp + 300
    );
    
    uint256 usdcBalance = IERC20(USDC_ADDRESS).balanceOf(address(this));
    
    // Add liquidity
    IUniswapV2Router02(uniswapRouter).addLiquidity(
        aecToken,
        USDC_ADDRESS,
        aecForLiquidity,
        usdcBalance,
        0, // Accept any amount
        0, // Accept any amount
        address(this), // LP tokens stay in contract
        block.timestamp + 300
    );
    
    // Stake LP tokens permanently
    uint256 lpBalance = IERC20(uniswapPair).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(uniswapPair).approve(lpStaking, lpBalance);
    IAECStakingLP(lpStaking).stakeForProtocol(lpBalance);
}
\`\`\`

**Reward Distribution Logic:**
\`\`\`solidity
function distributeRewards(uint256 totalRewards) internal {
    // Calculate allocations
    uint256 tokenStakingRewards = (totalRewards * 375) / 1000; // 37.5%
    uint256 lpStakingRewards = (totalRewards * 500) / 1000;    // 50.0%
    uint256 nftStakingRewards = (totalRewards * 125) / 1000;   // 12.5%
    
    // Distribute to staking contracts
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(tokenStaking, tokenStakingRewards);
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(lpStaking, lpStakingRewards);
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(nftStaking, nftStakingRewards);
    
    // Notify staking contracts of new rewards
    IAECStaking(tokenStaking).notifyRewardAmount(tokenStakingRewards);
    IAECStakingLP(lpStaking).notifyRewardAmount(lpStakingRewards);
    IAECStakingNFT(nftStaking).notifyRewardAmount(nftStakingRewards);
}
\`\`\`

## 3.4 Emergency Safeguards

**Fail-Safe Mechanisms:**
- Minimum processing thresholds prevent spam
- Maximum gas limits prevent DoS attacks
- Slippage protection on DEX operations
- Balance verification before all transfers

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful failure on external contract calls
- Event logging for all error conditions
- Automatic retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Circuit breakers for extreme conditions

# 4. Staking System Architecture

## 4.1 Token Staking Contract

The token staking contract allows users to stake AEC tokens for rewards with optional lock periods for multiplier bonuses.

**Contract Structure:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract AECStaking {
    struct StakeInfo {
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 lockPeriod;
        uint256 lockStart;
        uint256 multiplier;
        uint256 rewardDebt;
    }
    
    mapping(address => StakeInfo[]) public userStakes;
    
    // Lock periods and multipliers
    uint256 public constant LOCK_30_DAYS = 30 days;
    uint256 public constant LOCK_90_DAYS = 90 days;
    uint256 public constant LOCK_180_DAYS = 180 days;
    
    uint256 public constant MULTIPLIER_30_DAYS = 1100; // 1.1x
    uint256 public constant MULTIPLIER_90_DAYS = 1300; // 1.3x
    uint256 public constant MULTIPLIER_180_DAYS = 1600; // 1.6x
    uint256 public constant MULTIPLIER_NO_LOCK = 1000; // 1.0x
}
\`\`\`

**Staking Logic:**
\`\`\`solidity
function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 lockPeriod) external {
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");
    require(isValidLockPeriod(lockPeriod), "Invalid lock period");
    
    // Transfer tokens from user
    IERC20(aecToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    
    // Calculate multiplier
    uint256 multiplier = getMultiplier(lockPeriod);
    
    // Create stake
    userStakes[msg.sender].push(StakeInfo({
        amount: amount,
        lockPeriod: lockPeriod,
        lockStart: block.timestamp,
        multiplier: multiplier,
        rewardDebt: 0
    }));
    
    // Update global tracking
    totalStaked += amount;
    totalWeightedStake += (amount * multiplier) / 1000;
    
    emit Staked(msg.sender, amount, lockPeriod, multiplier);
}
\`\`\`

**Reward Calculation:**
Rewards are calculated based on weighted stake (stake amount × multiplier) relative to total weighted stakes:

\`\`\`solidity
function calculateRewards(address user, uint256 stakeIndex) public view returns (uint256) {
    StakeInfo memory stakeInfo = userStakes[user][stakeIndex];
    uint256 weightedStake = (stakeInfo.amount * stakeInfo.multiplier) / 1000;
    
    uint256 rewardShare = (weightedStake * accRewardPerShare) / 1e12;
    return rewardShare - stakeInfo.rewardDebt;
}
\`\`\`

---PAGE_BREAK---

## 4.2 LP Staking Contract

The LP staking contract provides the highest rewards (50% of total protocol rewards) to liquidity providers who stake their AEC/USDC LP tokens.

**Enhanced Features:**
- Higher reward allocation than token staking
- Longer lock periods available
- Protocol-owned liquidity integration
- Automatic compounding options

**LP Staking Implementation:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract AECStakingLP {
    struct LPStakeInfo {
        uint256 lpAmount;
        uint256 lockPeriod;
        uint256 lockStart;
        uint256 multiplier;
        uint256 rewardDebt;
        bool autoCompound;
    }
    
    // Extended lock periods for LP staking
    uint256 public constant LOCK_7_DAYS = 7 days;
    uint256 public constant LOCK_30_DAYS = 30 days;
    uint256 public constant LOCK_90_DAYS = 90 days;
    
    uint256 public constant LP_MULTIPLIER_7_DAYS = 1000;  // 1.0x
    uint256 public constant LP_MULTIPLIER_30_DAYS = 1200; // 1.2x
    uint256 public constant LP_MULTIPLIER_90_DAYS = 1500; // 1.5x
}
\`\`\`

**Protocol-Owned Liquidity Integration:**
The contract includes special handling for protocol-owned LP tokens that are permanently staked:

\`\`\`solidity
function stakeForProtocol(uint256 lpAmount) external {
    require(msg.sender == perpetualEngine, "Only PerpetualEngine");
    
    // Protocol stakes get base multiplier but permanent lock
    protocolStake.amount += lpAmount;
    protocolStake.multiplier = 1000; // 1.0x base multiplier
    
    totalLPStaked += lpAmount;
    totalWeightedLPStake += lpAmount; // 1.0x multiplier
    
    emit ProtocolStaked(lpAmount);
}
\`\`\`

**Auto-Compounding Feature:**
Users can enable automatic reward compounding to maximize returns:

\`\`\`solidity
function enableAutoCompound(uint256 stakeIndex) external {
    LPStakeInfo storage stakeInfo = userLPStakes[msg.sender][stakeIndex];
    stakeInfo.autoCompound = true;
    
    emit AutoCompoundEnabled(msg.sender, stakeIndex);
}

function compound(address user, uint256 stakeIndex) external {
    LPStakeInfo storage stakeInfo = userLPStakes[user][stakeIndex];
    require(stakeInfo.autoCompound, "Auto-compound not enabled");
    
    uint256 rewards = calculateLPRewards(user, stakeIndex);
    if (rewards > 0) {
        // Convert rewards to LP tokens and add to stake
        uint256 newLPTokens = convertRewardsToLP(rewards);
        stakeInfo.lpAmount += newLPTokens;
        
        emit Compounded(user, stakeIndex, rewards, newLPTokens);
    }
}
\`\`\`

---PAGE_BREAK---

## 4.3 NFT Staking Contract

The NFT staking contract allows holders of Aetheria NFTs to stake them for rewards, with different multipliers based on NFT rarity.

**NFT Staking Structure:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract AECStakingNFT {
    struct NFTStakeInfo {
        uint256 tokenId;
        uint256 stakeStart;
        uint256 multiplier;
        uint256 rewardDebt;
    }
    
    mapping(address => NFTStakeInfo[]) public userNFTStakes;
    mapping(uint256 => address) public stakedNFTOwner;
    
    // Rarity multipliers
    uint256 public constant COMMON_MULTIPLIER = 1000;    // 1.0x
    uint256 public constant UNCOMMON_MULTIPLIER = 1200;  // 1.2x
    uint256 public constant RARE_MULTIPLIER = 1500;     // 1.5x
    uint256 public constant EPIC_MULTIPLIER = 2000;     // 2.0x
    uint256 public constant LEGENDARY_MULTIPLIER = 3000; // 3.0x
}
\`\`\`

**NFT Staking Logic:**
\`\`\`solidity
function stakeNFT(uint256 tokenId) external {
    require(IERC721(aetheriaNFT).ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not NFT owner");
    
    // Transfer NFT to staking contract
    IERC721(aetheriaNFT).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
    
    // Get NFT rarity and multiplier
    uint256 rarity = IAetheriaNFT(aetheriaNFT).getRarity(tokenId);
    uint256 multiplier = getRarityMultiplier(rarity);
    
    // Create NFT stake
    userNFTStakes[msg.sender].push(NFTStakeInfo({
        tokenId: tokenId,
        stakeStart: block.timestamp,
        multiplier: multiplier,
        rewardDebt: 0
    }));
    
    stakedNFTOwner[tokenId] = msg.sender;
    
    // Update global tracking
    totalNFTsStaked += 1;
    totalWeightedNFTStake += multiplier;
    
    emit NFTStaked(msg.sender, tokenId, multiplier);
}
\`\`\`

**Rarity-Based Rewards:**
Different NFT rarities provide different reward multipliers:

\`\`\`solidity
function getRarityMultiplier(uint256 rarity) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (rarity == 0) return COMMON_MULTIPLIER;
    if (rarity == 1) return UNCOMMON_MULTIPLIER;
    if (rarity == 2) return RARE_MULTIPLIER;
    if (rarity == 3) return EPIC_MULTIPLIER;
    if (rarity == 4) return LEGENDARY_MULTIPLIER;
    return COMMON_MULTIPLIER; // Default to common
}
\`\`\`

## 4.4 Reward Calculation Logic

**Unified Reward System:**
All staking contracts use a similar reward calculation mechanism based on weighted stakes:

\`\`\`solidity
function updateRewards() internal {
    if (totalWeightedStake == 0) return;
    
    uint256 newRewards = pendingRewards();
    accRewardPerShare += (newRewards * 1e12) / totalWeightedStake;
    lastRewardUpdate = block.timestamp;
}

function calculateUserRewards(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalUserRewards = 0;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < userStakes[user].length; i++) {
        StakeInfo memory stake = userStakes[user][i];
        uint256 weightedStake = (stake.amount * stake.multiplier) / 1000;
        uint256 rewardShare = (weightedStake * accRewardPerShare) / 1e12;
        totalUserRewards += rewardShare - stake.rewardDebt;
    }
    
    return totalUserRewards;
}

# 5. Mathematical Endowment

## 5.1 Release Mechanism

The Mathematical Endowment contract implements the core sustainability mechanism of the AEC protocol through automated monthly releases.

**Contract Implementation:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract MathematicalEndowment {
    uint256 public constant INITIAL_BALANCE = 311_111_111 * 10**18;
    uint256 public constant RELEASE_RATE = 500; // 0.5% in basis points
    uint256 public constant RELEASE_INTERVAL = 30 days;
    
    uint256 public currentBalance;
    uint256 public lastReleaseTime;
    uint256 public totalReleased;
    uint256 public releaseCount;
    
    address public perpetualEngine;
    
    constructor(address _perpetualEngine) {
        currentBalance = INITIAL_BALANCE;
        lastReleaseTime = block.timestamp;
        perpetualEngine = _perpetualEngine;
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Release Logic:**
\`\`\`solidity
function releaseMonthlyFunds() external {
    require(
        block.timestamp >= lastReleaseTime + RELEASE_INTERVAL,
        "Release interval not met"
    );
    require(currentBalance > 0, "No funds to release");
    
    // Calculate release amount (0.5% of current balance)
    uint256 releaseAmount = (currentBalance * RELEASE_RATE) / 100000;
    
    // Update state
    currentBalance -= releaseAmount;
    totalReleased += releaseAmount;
    releaseCount++;
    lastReleaseTime = block.timestamp;
    
    // Transfer to PerpetualEngine
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(perpetualEngine, releaseAmount);
    
    // Trigger processing
    IPerpetualEngine(perpetualEngine).processEndowmentRelease(releaseAmount);
    
    emit MonthlyRelease(releaseAmount, currentBalance, releaseCount);
}
\`\`\`

## 5.2 Mathematical Proofs

**Infinite Operation Proof:**
The mathematical endowment is designed to provide funding indefinitely through the following mathematical relationship:

\`\`\`
Balance(n) = Initial_Balance × (0.995)^n
Release(n) = Balance(n-1) × 0.005

Where n = number of months since deployment
\`\`\`

**Proof of Infinite Operation:**
\`\`\`
lim(n→∞) Balance(n) = lim(n→∞) 311,111,111 × (0.995)^n = 0

However, for any finite n:
Balance(n) > 0, therefore Release(n+1) > 0

This proves that for any finite time period, 
the endowment will continue to provide funding.
\`\`\`

**Practical Implications:**
- After 10 years: ~63% of endowment remains
- After 20 years: ~48% of endowment remains  
- After 50 years: ~22% of endowment remains
- The protocol can operate indefinitely on endowment alone

## 5.3 Automation Logic

**Community Incentives:**
Anyone can trigger the monthly release and earn a small incentive:

\`\`\`solidity
function releaseWithIncentive() external {
    require(canRelease(), "Cannot release yet");
    
    uint256 releaseAmount = calculateReleaseAmount();
    uint256 incentive = (releaseAmount * 10) / 10000; // 0.1% incentive
    
    // Execute release
    executeRelease(releaseAmount - incentive);
    
    // Pay incentive to caller
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(msg.sender, incentive);
    
    emit IncentivePaid(msg.sender, incentive);
}
\`\`\`

**Automated Monitoring:**
The contract includes view functions for monitoring and automation:

\`\`\`solidity
function canRelease() public view returns (bool) {
    return block.timestamp >= lastReleaseTime + RELEASE_INTERVAL;
}

function timeUntilNextRelease() public view returns (uint256) {
    if (canRelease()) return 0;
    return (lastReleaseTime + RELEASE_INTERVAL) - block.timestamp;
}

function calculateReleaseAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
    return (currentBalance * RELEASE_RATE) / 100000;
}

function projectedBalance(uint256 months) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = currentBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < months; i++) {
        balance = (balance * 99500) / 100000; // 0.5% reduction
    }
    return balance;
}
\`\`\`

## 5.4 Security Considerations

**Immutable Parameters:**
All core parameters are immutable and cannot be changed:
- Release rate (0.5%)
- Release interval (30 days)
- Initial balance
- Target contract (PerpetualEngine)

**Access Control:**
- No admin functions
- No pause mechanisms
- No upgrade capabilities
- Community-triggered releases only

**Fail-Safe Mechanisms:**
- Balance verification before releases
- Interval enforcement
- Overflow protection
- Event logging for transparency

# 6. Governance Framework

## 6.1 Limited Governance Scope

AetherCycle implements minimal governance to prevent corruption while maintaining founder accountability. The governance system has extremely limited scope compared to traditional DeFi protocols.

**Governance Contract:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract AECGovernance {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;
        ProposalType proposalType;
        string description;
        uint256 votingStart;
        uint256 votingEnd;
        uint256 votesFor;
        uint256 votesAgainst;
        bool executed;
        mapping(address => bool) hasVoted;
    }
    
    enum ProposalType {
        EXTEND_FOUNDER_VESTING,
        BURN_FOUNDER_ALLOCATION
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCount;
    
    // Voting parameters
    uint256 public constant VOTING_PERIOD = 7 days;
    uint256 public constant MINIMUM_QUORUM = 10; // 10% of total supply
    uint256 public constant APPROVAL_THRESHOLD = 60; // 60% approval required
}
\`\`\`

**Governance Powers:**
The DAO can only vote on two types of proposals:

1. **Extend Founder Vesting:** Extend the 5-year founder vesting period by up to 2 additional years
2. **Burn Founder Allocation:** Permanently destroy the entire founder allocation

**What Governance CANNOT Control:**
- Tax rates or economic parameters
- Smart contract upgrades (contracts are immutable)
- Protocol pause or emergency stops
- Token supply or minting
- Staking parameters or rewards
- PerpetualEngine operations

## 6.2 Voting Mechanisms

**Voting Power:**
Voting power is based on AEC token holdings at the time of proposal creation (snapshot voting):

\`\`\`solidity
function createProposal(
    ProposalType proposalType,
    string memory description
) external returns (uint256) {
    require(
        IERC20(aecToken).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= MINIMUM_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD,
        "Insufficient tokens to create proposal"
    );
    
    uint256 proposalId = proposalCount++;
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    
    proposal.id = proposalId;
    proposal.proposalType = proposalType;
    proposal.description = description;
    proposal.votingStart = block.timestamp;
    proposal.votingEnd = block.timestamp + VOTING_PERIOD;
    
    // Take snapshot of total supply for quorum calculation
    proposal.totalSupplySnapshot = IERC20(aecToken).totalSupply();
    
    emit ProposalCreated(proposalId, proposalType, description);
    return proposalId;
}
\`\`\`

**Voting Process:**
\`\`\`solidity
function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    require(block.timestamp >= proposal.votingStart, "Voting not started");
    require(block.timestamp <= proposal.votingEnd, "Voting ended");
    require(!proposal.hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
    
    uint256 votingPower = IERC20(aecToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(votingPower > 0, "No voting power");
    
    proposal.hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    
    if (support) {
        proposal.votesFor += votingPower;
    } else {
        proposal.votesAgainst += votingPower;
    }
    
    emit Voted(proposalId, msg.sender, support, votingPower);
}
\`\`\`

## 6.3 Founder Accountability

**Founder Vesting Contract:**
\`\`\`solidity
contract FounderVesting {
    uint256 public constant FOUNDER_ALLOCATION = 8_888_888 * 10**18;
    uint256 public constant INITIAL_VESTING_PERIOD = 5 * 365 days;
    
    uint256 public vestingStart;
    uint256 public vestingEnd;
    uint256 public totalVested;
    bool public allocationBurned;
    
    address public founder;
    address public governance;
    
    modifier onlyGovernance() {
        require(msg.sender == governance, "Only governance");
        _;
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Vesting Extension:**
The community can vote to extend founder vesting by up to 2 additional years:

\`\`\`solidity
function extendVesting(uint256 additionalDays) external onlyGovernance {
    require(additionalDays <= 730 days, "Cannot extend more than 2 years");
    require(!allocationBurned, "Allocation already burned");
    
    vestingEnd += additionalDays;
    
    emit VestingExtended(additionalDays, vestingEnd);
}
\`\`\`

**Allocation Burning:**
The community can vote to permanently destroy the founder allocation:

\`\`\`solidity
function burnFounderAllocation() external onlyGovernance {
    require(!allocationBurned, "Already burned");
    require(totalVested == 0, "Cannot burn after vesting started");
    
    allocationBurned = true;
    
    // Burn the tokens
    IERC20(aecToken).transfer(BURN_ADDRESS, FOUNDER_ALLOCATION);
    
    emit FounderAllocationBurned(FOUNDER_ALLOCATION);
}
\`\`\`

## 6.4 Community Controls

**Proposal Execution:**
Successful proposals are automatically executed after the voting period:

\`\`\`solidity
function executeProposal(uint256 proposalId) external {
    Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    require(block.timestamp > proposal.votingEnd, "Voting still active");
    require(!proposal.executed, "Already executed");
    
    uint256 totalVotes = proposal.votesFor + proposal.votesAgainst;
    uint256 quorum = (proposal.totalSupplySnapshot * MINIMUM_QUORUM) / 100;
    
    require(totalVotes >= quorum, "Quorum not met");
    
    uint256 approvalRate = (proposal.votesFor * 100) / totalVotes;
    require(approvalRate >= APPROVAL_THRESHOLD, "Insufficient approval");
    
    proposal.executed = true;
    
    if (proposal.proposalType == ProposalType.EXTEND_FOUNDER_VESTING) {
        IFounderVesting(founderVesting).extendVesting(proposal.extensionDays);
    } else if (proposal.proposalType == ProposalType.BURN_FOUNDER_ALLOCATION) {
        IFounderVesting(founderVesting).burnFounderAllocation();
    }
    
    emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId);
}
\`\`\`

**Community Safeguards:**
- High quorum requirements prevent small group control
- Supermajority approval threshold (60%) for all proposals
- Limited proposal types prevent scope creep
- Transparent voting process with full event logging
